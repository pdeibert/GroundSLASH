Parser and Grounder for the deep probabilistic programming language (DPPL) SLASH. SLASH is neural-probabilistic extension of the Answer Set Programming (ASP) paradigm. For more information, see:
* [SLASH: Embracing Probabilistic Circuits into Neural Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03395)
* [Scalable Neural-Probabilistic Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08397)

GroundSLASH is based is a modification of the [ASPy](https://github.com/pdeibert/ASPy) parser and grounder for Answer Set programs.

Syntactic elements are implemented using classes which provide convenient methods and operators for handling them.
